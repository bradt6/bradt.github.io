I"†<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>My name is Brad. This is a blog about the various activities in my life be it courses, recommendations, random thoughts or things I just find interesting. This blog is a destination where I can jot various notes down with the hope of reinforcing my learning and potentially helping others along the way.</p>

<p>Im currently on a journey into the realm of software trying to learn its many intricacies. My desire is to learn how to build, maintain and ship applications which are sought after.</p>

<p>This blog is set up as an experiment to keep me accountable for trying to continually learn new things.</p>
